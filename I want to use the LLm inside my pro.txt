I want to use the LLm inside my project but dont know which model should i use 

I am providing some details of my project :
Assumptions	Use Cases
In 1 day, Bagging in 20 trucks is done by 1 Bagging plant.	Bagging Plant Asset Utilization Prediction
Peak Days, Maximum 11 Hours of Operation Time	Reducing Truck Wait Times
Non-Peak Days, Maximum 8 Hours of Operation Time	Day Planner that lets the Truck have X bags of Premium Quality Barley filled and Y bags of Grade 2 Barley Bags Filled
Only 10 percent of Trucks with Mix Grade Request 	Predicting Truck Numbers for Next Days
Around 25 Minutes of Loading Time for a Single Truck	Is there a need to increase or decrease the number of bagging plants?   
Bagging Plant Asset is overutilized if the value > 1.5	How to distribute the Load on various Bagging Plants?
	
	
	
Stockyard Time = Entry Moving Time Duration + Wait Time + Barley Loading Time + Exit Moving Time Duration	
	
	"G1 - Bagging Plant B1 (takes 3 hours) - Asset Utilization in a day - Wait Time of Truck (1 hour)
G2 - Bagging Plant B2 (takes 3 hours) - Asset Utilization in a day - Wait Time of Truck (1 hour)
G3 - Bagging Plant B3 (takes 3 hours) - Asset Utilization in a day - Wait Time of Truck (1 hour)"
